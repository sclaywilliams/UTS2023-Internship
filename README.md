Continuous integration involves frequent additions and alterations to a larger codebase stored in a version controlled repository. It assists developers by automating the building, packaging, and testing of their applications, and helps to integrate and validate code from a wide range of platforms and tools. Continuous delivery follows on from this by automating the delivery to production, development, and testing environments. Continuous delivery allows developers to push their code changes seamlessly into their chosen environment.

The use of CI/CD in your development workflow is highly beneficial. It helps to improve workflow by allowing many people to work on the same codebase at the same time. It also helps in minimising errors and bugs in your codebase, as small snippets of code are reviewed each time before being sent to a test environment, and then into production.

Some of the tools used for CI/CD:
Docker - containerisation platform used for building, deploying, and running containers
Kurbernetes - orchestrates container systems (can be used with or without Docker)
Jenkins - open source automation platform for building, testing, and deploying code
